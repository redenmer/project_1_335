## How to use:
In order to use project1_starter.py Make sure to have the following on your system:
+ input.txt
+ project1_starter.py
+ output.txt

### Steps For best Results:

1. First thing you want to do is input person 1's schedule
2. Input Person 1's Clock-in and Clock-out time
3. The desired length for the meeting in terms of minutes
4. Input person 2's Schedule
5. Person 2's Clock-in and Clock-out time

**This program is very case and format sensitive**
**All inputs should follow the following format:**

```

[['09:00', '10:00'], ['11:30', '12:30'], ['14:30', '15:30']]
08:30,17:00
30
[['10:00', '11:00'], ['12:30', '13:30'], ['15:30', '16:30']]
09:00,17:30

```
**Unfortuntely this program only works if the following criteria are met**
**all value must be in military time xx:xx for any given time**
